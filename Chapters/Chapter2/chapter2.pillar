In order to simplify our task, we decide to build an embedded DSL instead of bulding a whole Parser.

We use the facilities of Pharo, in order to build a declarative API. The template of an ArduinoML is as follows :

[[[
#youAppName arduinoApp
    bricks:
        {
        ...
        };
    states:
        {
        ...
        };
    transitions:
        {
        ...
        }
]]]
